# Privacy Policy — Smart Bug Reporter Chrome Extension

Effective date: October 2025
Last updated: October 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the Smart Bug Reporter Chrome extension (“the Extension”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use it to generate diagnostic reports.
The Extension is published and maintained by FBusinessCenter.

We respect your privacy and are committed to ensuring that all data collected by this Extension remains secure and under your control.

## 2. Information Collected

The Extension only collects information when you manually trigger the “Generate Report” action.
It does not collect or transmit any data automatically in the background.

When generating a report, the following data may be gathered from the active browser tab:

- Screenshot of the visible webpage area. 
- Console logs (messages, warnings, and errors generated by the page). 
- JavaScript exceptions captured during execution. 
- Network requests made during the capture period. 
- Cookies associated with the active domain (values are masked/redacted). 
- LocalStorage and SessionStorage key/value pairs (sensitive keys are redacted). 
- Basic metadata: tab URL, hostname, timestamp, browser version, operating system, and platform.
- (Optional): If configured by your organization, the extension may communicate with a local native messaging host to encrypt, sign, or securely transfer the generated report.

## 3. How Information Is Used

The collected data is used solely to help reproduce and diagnose technical issues with the website you are testing or debugging.
Reports are automatically packaged into a ZIP file, which you can either:

- Download locally to your computer, or
- Upload manually or automatically to a server endpoint configured by your organization (for example, an internal bug tracking or ticketing system).

The Extension does not transmit any data to third-party services or external servers outside of those explicitly configured by you.

## 4. Data Retention and Control

- The Extension stores no permanent data in the cloud.
- Any locally cached configuration values (such as upload endpoints or authentication tokens) are stored using Chrome’s storage.local API.
- You can delete these values anytime by uninstalling the extension or clearing Chrome’s extension data.
- Reports downloaded to your computer remain under your full control.

## 5. Permissions and Their Purpose

The Extension requests the following Chrome permissions:
